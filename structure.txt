🚧 Adapters we’re missing (to be future-proof & framework-agnostic)
1. HTTP / Transport Adapter

Purpose: decouple core from the web framework.

Adapters: express, fastify, nest, hapi, koa, maybe next-api later.

Why: so modules/controllers can just declare handlers, and the transport adapter wires them (routing, middlewares, validation, error handling).

Without this, we risk tying modules directly to Express.

👉 This is the next logical adapter to build — because every module (identity, session, oauth) needs routing.

2. Auth/Token Adapter

Purpose: unify token signing, verification, rotation.

Adapters: jwt, paseto, maybe opaque tokens.

Why: different orgs want different strategies; some regulated environments require PASETO over JWT.

Role: Provide sign(payload, options) and verify(token) interfaces.

Core modules (session, MFA, identity) will depend on this.

3. Storage / Blob Adapter

Purpose: handle file uploads, profile pictures, documents, audit exports, etc.

Adapters: s3, gcs, azure-blob, local-fs.

Why: SaaS often needs user profile storage or consent export downloads.

4. Queue / Jobs Adapter (optional but common)

Purpose: handle async background jobs (email, billing events, analytics).

Adapters: bullmq, rabbitmq, kafka, in-memory.

Why: good for scaling — send email events, billing webhook processing, etc., off the main thread.

5. Logger Adapter

Purpose: unify logging.

Adapters: pino, winston, bunyan, console fallback.

Why: Some companies want structured logging shipped to ELK/Datadog.

(We have a logger in @arc-id/common, but making it an adapter keeps it pluggable).

6. Analytics/Telemetry Adapter (stretch goal, but important later)

Purpose: send events to Mixpanel, Segment, Posthog, etc.

Why: devs using ArcID will want to track user identity events.

Adapter-based design allows opting-in or stubbing out analytics.

⚡️ Summary

✅ You already have db, mail, cache, billing.

🚧 Missing but valuable:

HTTP adapter (most urgent, needed for modules)

Token adapter (needed for session + auth flows)

Storage adapter (optional now, useful later)

Queue adapter (for jobs)

Logger adapter (pluggable logging)

Analytics adapter (stretch goal)
